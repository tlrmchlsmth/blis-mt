BLIS framework
README
---

Thank you for deciding to try out the BLIS framework!

BLIS is a portable framework for instantiating BLAS-like libraries. The
framework was designed to isolate essential kernels of computation that,
when optimized, immediately enable optimized implementations of most of
its commonly used and computationally intensive operations.

BLIS has many features. For more detailed information about the project,
please check the BLIS homepage:

  http://code.google.com/p/blis/

You can keep in touch with developers and other users of the project by
joining one or more of the following mailing lists:

  o blis-announce - http://groups.google.com/group/blis-announce 
    Used only for announcements and other important messages regarding
    BLIS.

  o blis-discuss - http://groups.google.com/group/blis-discuss
    Please join and post to this mailing list if you have general questions
    or feedback regarding BLIS. Application developers (end users) should
    probably post here.

  o blis-devel - http://groups.google.com/group/blis-devel
    Please join and post to this mailing list if you are a BLIS developer
    (i.e., you are trying to use BLIS to create libraries, you want to
    write kernels for the framework, or you are trying to modify or extend
    the framework itself).

Also, please read the LICENSE file for information on copying and
distributing this software.

For a step-by-step guide on configuring, compiling, and installing BLIS,
please read the INSTALL file. Also, please check the BLIS website's wiki
page for other useful how-to guides.

Thanks again for your interest in BLIS!
